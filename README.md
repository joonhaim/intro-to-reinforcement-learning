## üìö Assignments

### ‚úÖ **Assignment 1 ‚Äì Exploration Strategies in Bandits**
Focuses on action-value estimation and exploration methods in multi-armed bandit problems:
- Œµ-Greedy
- Optimistic Initialization
- Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)

Includes plots of average rewards and comparison of strategies.

---

### ‚úÖ **Assignment 2 ‚Äì Model-Free Reinforcement Learning**
Implements and compares several model-free RL algorithms in a custom gridworld:
- Q-Learning
- SARSA
- Expected SARSA
- n-step SARSA
- Windy Environment variant

Includes learning curves, greedy policies, and parameter experiments.

### üìÅ Structure

Each assignment is in its own folder (e.g., `IRL_A1`, `IRL_A2`) and typically includes:
- Agent/environment implementations
- Experiment scripts
- Plots and visualizations
- A final report (`report.pdf`) with results and interpretations
